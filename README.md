Players love video games.
Are most popular games most viewed on live channels such as youtube? Or in other words, when a game attracts more players, does it mean it also has more live show viewers?
To explore this question, the project scraped two dataset: most played video games from wiki, and most viewed live games from youtube games. By running a regression of the overlapping part of the two lists, the conclusion is: with limited data on hand, it is hard to demonstrate that more popular games are more viewed.
